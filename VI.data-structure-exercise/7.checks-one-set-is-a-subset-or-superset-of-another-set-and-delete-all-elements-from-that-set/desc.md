Exercise 7: Checks if one set is a subset or superset of another set. If found, delete all elements from that set
Given:

first_set = {27, 43, 34}
second_set = {34, 93, 22, 27, 43, 53, 48}
Expected Output:

First set is subset of second set - True
Second set is subset of First set - False

First set is Super set of second set - False
Second set is Super set of First set - True

First Set set()
Second Set {67, 73, 43, 48, 83, 57, 29}
